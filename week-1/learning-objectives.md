## Self Evaluation Card

Good programmers are accurate self assessors. Spend a few minutes every day
thinking about where you stand up the current weeks learning objectives. To do
so:

1. Copy and paste this score card into your `boots/your-name.md` file
2. Indicate where you feel you stand in each of the learning objectives.
   (use an [emoji](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) for :+1: :gem:!)
3. Include a tweet-sized blurb about what you learned today.

| Coders Mindset | Testing & TDD | Debugging | Ruby Webapps | ActiveRecord | HTML & CSS |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------- |
|                |               |           |              |              |            |

## Testing and TDD

## Debugging
1. I create hypothesis about making the code do what I want before typing the
   code.
1. I test my hypothesis with code before I google or ask for help

## Ruby Webapps

## ActiveRecord

## HTML & CSS
