## Self Evaluation Card

Spend a few minutes every day thinking about how you're doing with the weeks
learning objectives:

1. Copy and paste this score card into your `boots/your-name.md` file
2. Indicate where you feel you stand in each of the learning objectives.
   (use an [emoji](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) for :+1: :gem:!)
3. Include a tweet-sized blurb about what you learned today.
