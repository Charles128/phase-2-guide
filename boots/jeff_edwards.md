quirky thing I realized about myself this weekend - 
 The two neighborhoods/cities I have live the longest in my adult life are
 Berkeley and the Haight. However || In spite of ||  Because of this...I
 really don't like tie-dye. Hey I don't mind others wearing it most of the
 time, but the idea of wearing it myself really irks me.
