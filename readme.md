# How This Phase Works
Phase 2 is broken into three weeks with the following themes:

* Testing and Simple Web Applications
* Enhancing Web Applications with JavaScript
* Advanced Web Application Techniques

Each day works in pretty much the same way:
* Mornings are for pairing and preparation
* Afternoons are for group projects
* Evenings are for optimizing your learning

For more information, peruse the [week by week
breakdown](#week-by-week-breakdown), the [day in the
life](#a-day-in-the-life), and [what we work on](#what-do-we-work-on).

## Week By Week Breakdown

### [Week 1](week-1.md) - Testing, Simple Web Applications, and Github
In week 1, we introduce rspec, sinatra, ActiveRecord, Github, and Heroku. Your
primary objective is to feel confident that you can create simple web
applications on a team and on your own, test them, and get them hosted on the
Internet for your friends and loved ones to see.

### [Week 2](week-2.md) - Enhancing Web Applications With JavaScript
In week 2 we add JavaScript, the best programming language ever, as a way to
enhance your web applications. By the end of this week you should be capable of
creating web applications that leverage JavaScript to create rich interactions.

### [Week 3](week-3.md) - Non-trivial Web Applications
Week 3 ties it all together. Now that you're capable of creating rich web
applications, you must push your abilities to their limit as you discover how to
use AJAX, background jobs, OAuth, and other APIs.

## A Day In The Life

### Mornings
On weekdays we meet in the meadow for standup at 9AM.

After standup, boots are encouraged to:

1. Work through the morning challenge.
2. Prepare their afternoon [lightning talk](#lightning-talks).
3. Work on their group projects.

Mornings may include an optional lecture on a specific topic.

### Afternoons
Monday - Friday at 2 PM we meet in the cave for lightning talks. Lightning talks
are ~5 minutes long, followed by 5 minutes for discussion.

After lightning talks, teams work on [group projects](#group-projects). Teams
should stop working on projects at 6 PM and must stop work at 7PM.

### Evenings
At 6 PM, you should begin to wrap up group projects for the day.  After 7PM, you
should no longer be working on your group project. Instead you should spend the
time [optimizing your learning.](#optimizing-your-learning)

## What Do We Work On?

### Group Projects
Group projects are only to be worked on until 6~7pm. You will not 'finish' your
group project. There is always more to do, more enhancements to be made, more
features to be added, and more bugs to fix. This is why there is a 7PM hard
stop.

### Lightning Talks
Lightning talks are 5 minutes where you answer a single question or discuss a
specific topic. By restricting it to 5 minutes, you must choose the most
important things to talk about.  Generally the best lightning talks is 1 idea,
split into 2~3 parts. Any more parts and it gets rushed or too high level.

Lightning talks use a whiteboard. No projector allowed! Feel free to practice
sketching before giving the talk.

### Optimizing Your Learning
We all learn in different ways. Some of us learn best by:

1. Playing with a technology on their own or with a pair
2. Reviewing videos and tutorials
3. Setting an absurd goal and working towards it
4. Sleeping

In the week overview, We've aggregated some of the best tutorials we (and
previous boots) could find, collected a few useful and interesting technologies,
and even given some cahrazy ideas you may want to try implementing on your own
or as a group. Of course, feel free to pursue your own!
